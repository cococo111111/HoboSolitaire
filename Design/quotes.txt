STAR
Here the first step is to enumerate the things that are 'in' the world: houses, trees, people, mountains, stars.

TABLE
So when we designate this entity with the term 'Dasein', we are expressing not its "what" (as if it were a table, house or tree) but its Being.

HAND
The act of hammering itself discovers the specific "handiness" of the hammer.

TIME
Time must be brought to light and genuinely grasped as the horizon of every understanding of being.

SPIRIT
However, the "substance" of human being is not spirit as the synthesis of body and soul: it is rather _existence_.

SPACE
Space is not in the subject, nor does that subject observe the word "as if" it were in space. Rather, the "subject," correctly understood ontologically, Dasein, is spatial in a primordial sense.

SHIP
You cannot heal a single human being, not even with psychotherapy, if you do not first restore his relationship to Being.

WORLD
Philosophy fails again and again in fulfilling the task: working out the idea of a "natural concept of world."

LIGHT
Thus the sun whose light and warmth we make use of every day has its circumspectly discovered, eminent places in terms of the changing usability of what it gives us: sunrise, noon, sunset, midnight.

TREE
When we are seeking the essence of "tree," we have to become aware that That which
pervades every tree, as tree, is not itself a tree that can be encountered among all the other trees.
